### 0.1 Basic Computation

**What is a Computer?**
- Hard to define
- Interesting to think about

**Computer Components**
- A *processor* to interpret and execute programs.
- a *memory* to store both data and programs
- An *input/output* mechanism for transferring data to and from the outside world.

**What is a Program?**
From the computer system point-of-view, a *program* is a list of ordered machine instructions.

**Generations of Programming Languages**
1) 1st Generation: Machine Language
	- Purely binary
	- hard for humans to understand
2) 2nd Generation: Assembly Language
	- human-readable form of machine language
	- easy translation to machine language
	- very machine dependent
3) 3rd Generation: High level Languages
	- common programing constructs are provided
	- machine independent (for the most part)
	- strict syntax and rules
	- compilers convert to assembly
