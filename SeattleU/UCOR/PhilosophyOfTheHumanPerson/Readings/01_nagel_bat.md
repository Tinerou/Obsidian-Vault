## On discussion day we talk about:
- The phenomenon of consciousness
- Reductionism in neuroscience
- What should count as an "explanation" of consciousness?
- How should we understand different forms of consciousness?
- Are there facts that cannot be explained by scientific methods?

**Theme:** Consciousness is complex and has been overly-simplified.

**Thesis**(in-class): Consciousness / Subjective Experience is the phenomenon that makes the mind/body problem unsolvable (at least for the time being).
- Can't conceptualize an explanation that's physical of consciousness.

Author gives a lot of reasons by analogy:
Martian Scientist (blind): Could form a perfect mathematical understanding of a rainbow but couldn't form the concept of a rainbow.

## Notes
### Definition of consciousness
"But fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism --something it is like for the organism." (pg.436 or 3_pdf)
- The wording here confused me at first, but reading it back closer I realized that it's saying that "if there is a feeling of being something to the organism it is conscious". Thomas Nagel refers to this as "subjective character of experience".
- The issue with this as mentioned is that saying this conflicts with things like AI.
### Does consciousness cause behavior?
Thomas Nagel brings up interesting arguments against how conscious mental states and events cause behavior:
- He doesn't necessarily disagree with it but says that it "exhausts their analysis".

### Subjective vs. Objective (*pour-soi* vs *en-soi*)

There's a difference between subjectivity and point-of-view.

When trying to think from a bat's perspective, "it tells me only what it would be like for me to behave as a bat behaves. But that is not the question. I want to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat. Yet if I try to imagine this, I am restricted to the resources of my own mind" (pg. 439 or 6_pdf).

"We cannot form more than a schematic conception of *what it is like*"(pg. 439 or 6_pdf)
- refer back to [[#Definition of consciousness]]

There is an example on pg.440 or 7_pdf that uses an example of a bat trying to figure out what it would be like to be one of us. The issue is that the bat can only compare to what they have (such as hunger? If it is the same for both of us.)

Nagel mentions the "human language" such that us as humans cannot possibly comprehend what it is like to be a bat so languages cannot represent what it is like. "Reflection on what it is like to be a bat seems to lead us, therefore, to the conclusion that there are facts that do not consist in the truth of propositions expressible in a human language. We can be compelled to recognize the existence of such facts without being able to state or comprehend them" (pg. 441 or 8_pdf)
- Last sentence in this also interested me.

"In our own case we occupy the relevant point of view, but we will have as much difficulty understanding our own experience properly if we approach it from another point of view as we would if we tried to understand the experience of another species without taking up its point of view"(pg.442 or 9_pdf)
- Even for ourselves approaching from a 3rd person pov is different than 1st. We could never truly understand from outside our own perspective. (mind-body problem)

"The reduction can succeed only if the species-specific viewpoint is omitted from what is to be reduced"(pg. 445 12_pdf).

**behaviorism**: Theory of learning that states all behaviors are learned through interaction with the environment through "conditioning".
- *Adherence of Behaviorism*:
	- **Behavior**: Simply a response to a particular stimulus
	- **Behaviorism**: Only concerned with observable "stimulus-response behaviors". As the can be studied in a *systematic and observable manner*.
