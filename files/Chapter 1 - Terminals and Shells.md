### Terminal vs. Shell

- **Terminal** = A program that lets you type commands into a window on your computer
- **Shell** = Interprets the commands you type and executes them
    - Shells are often referred to as "REPLs"
    - **REPL** = Read Evaluate Print Loop
- **CLI** = Command Line Interface

### Variables

**Create a Variable:**

bash

```bash
name="Trey"
```

_Note: No spaces around the equals sign_

**Use a Variable:**

bash

```bash
echo $name
```

**Interpolate a Variable in a String:**

bash

```bash
echo "Hello $name"
```

### History Commands

- `history` - Shows your command history
- `clear` - Clears the terminal
