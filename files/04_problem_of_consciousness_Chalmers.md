## What we talk about 

- Distinguishing between "easy" and "hard" problems in neuroscience
- Functional explantations in biology and neuroscience
- Chalmers' suggestions for a science of consciousness
- Can science recognize phenomena that are not just physical?

**Theme:** Why is consciousness so hard to explain scientifically?

## Notes

"Consciousness is an ambiguous term, referring to many different phenomena" (pg. 1).
### "Easy" problems

- The ability to discriminate, categorize, and react to environmental stimuli
- The integration of information by a cognitive system
- The reportability of mental states
- The ability of a system to access its own internal states
- The focus of attention
- The deliberate control of behavior
- The difference between wakefulness and sleep

### "Hard" problems

"The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of *experience*" (pg. 2).
- The subjective aspect
