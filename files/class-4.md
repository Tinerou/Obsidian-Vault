2 Points of consensus:
1) Folk psychological understanding of the mind has been changed by science
2) Subjective experience/consciousness is an unusual phenomenon

Now we're moving into evolutionary theory...

Consensus: Evolutionary theory has changed our understanding of ourselves

What if anything, separates humans from other animals?
- tools
- language

**Morality?**

"Veneer Theory": By nature human beings pursue their own selfish interests;
				Morality (veneer perspective): Set of rules that constrain one's natural desire.
de Waal: 
- Strong evidence that other primates behave morally, thus it's human nature to behave morally.
- We know morality is part of human nature because we observe it on other species
- Defines (although not thoroughly) morality as a set of rules or codes of behavior and the correct intention.
- Chimp behaviors -> Cooperate for a specific goal(community survival)
Korsgaard: 
- Morality is a social practice that relies on a particular type of consciousness that *appears* to be unique to humans
- Vested Interest
	- Intentional Action: 
		- Insects may have the intention to perform actions (like eating)
		- more intelligent animals have affective motivation, also competing desires (though some insects may still have this).
		- Human intentional action: our desires to act are recognized as grounds/basis for a action. Immediate evaluation to determine whether it's a valid reason to act. 
Autonomy (Auto nomous): Now we use to talk about human minds because human mind is autonomous because we are capable of self-rule. Think back to "self-government".
Normative self-government: Requires self-consciousness that has reflective distance.

Arguments against Veneer Theory:
1) Not instinctual for humans to pursue best interests
2) For a social being, concept of "self interest" isn't well-formed
3) The theory implies a strange conception of humans
