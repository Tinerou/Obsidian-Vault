#gitNotes 

**PUSH:**

bash

```bash
git push origin main
```

Sends local changes to any "remote" (for most of my cases to GitHub)

bash

```bash
git push <localbranch>:<remotebranch>
```

**PULL:**

bash

```bash
git pull [<remote>/<branch>]
```

Fetching only gives us the metadata. With pull we can receive the actual file changes from a remote repo.

**PULL REQUEST** = Allows team members to see what changes are being proposed and to discuss them before they are merged into the main codebase.
