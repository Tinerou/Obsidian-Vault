The behavior of a sequential circuit can be described using a **finite state machine (FSM)**

A finite state machine consists of:
- A set of states (nodes): $S = {s_0, s_1, ..., s_k}$
- A starting state $s_0$
- A set of inputs: $X={x_0, x_1, ..., x_m}$
- A set of outputs: $Y={y_0, y_1, ..., y_n}$
- A transition function: $s(t+1)=T(s(t),x(t))$
- An output function(s) based on the current state and inputs: $y_n$ ...
