## Navigating Careers in Big Tech

PASSION
### Before getting an interview

#### Resume
Resume is the key for getting *interviews*
- Do the recruiters job for them (why are you different)
- *Impact-oriented*
- Know your audience, by considering relevant experiences
- Not more than one page
- Consistency, proof read, PDF format

No work experience?
Accomplished *X* , as measured by *Y*, by doing *Z*.
- Anything you did outside of just school, even if it's not coding. 
- Passion is important, even if it's not coding

### Preparing for an interview

**Golden Rules** of any interview
1) Think out loud 
	 - They want to know how you think
2) Ensure you end the interview with a working solution
	- Even if it's not elegant, just make sure it works. This is the most important part

What are interviewers looking for?
1) Problem solving skills
	- Ability to break down complex problems (e.g. create helper methods)
2) Critical thinking
	- Consider multiple ways to solve a problem
	- People are trained to find multiple solutions
3) Testability
	- Test your solution to ensure it actually solves the present problem
	- Why is this the solution?
	- What might break the code
4) Maintainability
	- Is the solution easy to understand and maintain?
	- This goes hand and hand with it being easily explainable

You will run into a bad interviewer who will not help you, even more reasons to follow the secret recipe.

The **secret** recipe
Note: Memorize these
1) Ask clarifying questions (sometimes they won't give information to test you on this)
2) Write down and verify assumptions (Question everything, make the interviewer help you)
3) Don't jump into the solution, prepare a plan, are there any alternatives? (Share your plan, focus on the solution you want to go for, even if there are alternatives you know of)
4) Consider maintainability (e.g. if coding, add comments)
5) Test your solution (e.g. if coding, literally test line by line, check literally all your variables, act like a debugger. Must go through thorough analysis, because you usually can't run code) {happy path}
6) Consider basic and corner cases, optimizations, alternative solutions

If you get stuck DO NOT be afraid to ask for help, but specify why you are stuck.

After the interview you can ask the interviewers questions about their jobs. This shows passion and you learn important things, whilst getting possible tips.
### Internships, but why?

Opportunity to grow and help create products and services used by billions. 
- The easiest way to get in to the tech industry

Does this candidate have potential?
- Is this person showing passion?
- This passion if not coding can be useful

There are internships for every level, so apply!

Stats off more about passion then later on in your career becomes more about expertise

Interviews are basically a long interview, which is why it's an easier way to get into the industry.
