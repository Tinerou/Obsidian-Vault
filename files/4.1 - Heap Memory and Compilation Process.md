### Heap

#### Dynamic Memory
The heap is used to store dynamic memory
There are 2 parts to the heap:
…

To allocate memory of size $n$:
- Look up the heap management table and find a free block of size $n$. 
- …

ANNA programs can have all four sections in this order (A little different than other programs):
1) Code (fixed size) 
2) Data (fixed size)
3) Heap (dynamically sized)
4) Stack (dynamically sized, starts at address `0x8000`)
…

- Dynamic memory in ANNA is simplified - only allocations (no deallocations)
- Heap management table is implemented using a single pointer
	- pointer points to next free word in memory
	- All memory in heap prior to pointer is used
	Heap is placed at the end of the program:
	```Assembly
	# heap section
	heapPtr: .fill &heap   # points to the start of &heap
	heap: .fill 0
	```
