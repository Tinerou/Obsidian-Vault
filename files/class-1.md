### Reductionism/ Reductive Explanations


**Visible Phenomenon:** Surface level, reduces complex ideas
Example:
- Parents: kids look similar
- "genes"
- DNA

### Mind/ Body Problem
**Mind**:
- non-physical

### Reasons to believe the mind is "caused" by the brain

When your "hangry" you know your angry due to that underlying factor of being hungry.

### Different kinds of Mental Phenomena

Remembering

**Consciousness**: 

### Physicalism: Everything is physical

Note: Maybe write essay about "soul" when talking about scientific knowledge and religious beliefs. Can things in that cannot be explained by science real? (cognitive dissinance in Nagel bat)

### Scientific Method

Observations <- An individual is responsible
Individual writes a sentence describing observation

Objectivity in science -> descriptions of the world that exclude terms that refer to the subject.
- Using words like "hot" or "lukewarm" when we could use facts like 35 degrees 

Objective account of consciousness -> An account of consciousness that makes no reference to the experience of consciousness
