## Notes
Takes on morality:
### Huwe:
Moral sentimentalism: Caring about how others view you
### Smith:
"He suggested that we would never think of our own minds if we were never exposed to other people. Contrary to what the privileged access view of the mind might lead you to suppose, we first spot mental attitudes in other people"(pg. 22)
### Darwin:
"This dissatisfaction is regret or remorse, and it is painful character ultimately teaches us to control our appetites when they conflict with our social instincts"
- Darwin, also shared a lot of views with Huwe on moral sentimentalism
