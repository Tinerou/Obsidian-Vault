When was the idea of culture recognized?
Matthew Arnold: famous in 1880s. British poetry wording came more from descent and biology instead of culture.

### Social Construct + Politics

If $X$ is natural it is immune to social change.
- Eventually we must understand objective science vs. pseudoscience
- Race vs. Race pseudoscience
- Biological sex vs. Gender

#### Haslanger
All knowledge is a social construct because all of it is organized by concepts from our culture.

Social construction of gender is *liberatory*… Implies that there is no eternal "women's nature".

Are all our categories and concepts social constructs? (objectivity vs. subjectivity)
- If yes, there is no reality independent of our thinking about reality.
**Causal Social Construction**: $X$ is caused by social forces.
Something that exists only because of social forces.
- "foul" ← A foul ball comes from the social idea of baseball(or other sports)
Discursive Social Construction: 
Discourse:
- Categories: function like scripts in theatre (shaped by a standard understanding of a category)
	- e.g. a student → has behavioral expectations
	- Even when trying to reject these, you are actively reacting to these categories.
**Constitutional Social Construction**: Can't refer to something without reference to social forces (culture).
**Pragmatic Social Construction:** Concepts that are socially constructed for social reasons.
- *Weakly* pragmatic social construction: Concepts that are constructed for *some* social reasons
	- e.g. In class example: toxic vs. nontoxic plants can be recognized because they are harmful to humans.
- *Strongly* pragmatic social construction: Concept exists for purely social reasons/social forces.
	- These concepts are effective (pay attention to them) because they hide the fact that they are 100% social constructs.
		- Claim that the concept is based on nature (or not socially constructed).

**Operative vs. Manifest Concept**
*Operative:* cool = tool to preserve social hierarchy
- Changes with society (playing video games used to not be cool)
*manifest:* How the concept appears in the mind.
- Some people really are cool.
	- Intrinsic

**Debunking**
Once you are aware that these are social constructions, it gives you some power over it (kind of freeing). More knowledge therefore an improvement.

## Notes

The idea of **Social construction** and how philosophical ideas can be reduced by this. But what is really socially constructed?

The idea of subjective and objective reality.

Lots of criticism over MacKinnon and his idea of what is "real".
