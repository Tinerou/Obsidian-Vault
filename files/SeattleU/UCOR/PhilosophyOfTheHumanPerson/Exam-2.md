### Two Part Prompt

1) What are the principal similarities and differences between Appiah’s views on the concept of race and Haslanger’s/Mills’ views on the concept of race? (approximately three to four pages)

2) On the basis of your answer to the previous question, defend a thesis about how we should use (or not use) the concept of race to understand contemporary society. (approximately two to three pages)
	- Given Appiah, Haslanger, and Mills ideas, what are we looking for in a contemporary society?
	- Can "race" be taken out of society? (Maybe acknowledge this but not speak about it).
	- no req

### Similarities

- All start from consensus view that humans have no races (in biological sense)
	- Compare to races with different animals
- Many people have had false beliefs about race
- Shared starting question: Why do people hold these false beliefs?
- Shared assumption: A clear understanding of the concept of race will produce a better analysis of social divisions in North America
- All 3 recognize the importance of intentional actions - Acts that are shaped by *concepts* we use to understand our self and others
	- Haslanger: All adults are socially constructed
	- Appiah: "Making people up"
	- Concepts work like "scripts" for people and are controlled by society.
		- Proof: Milestones can give you new expectations/scripts
		- Physiological differences can cause more "scripts".
		- Examples could be critiques of "scripts" (there are many out there)
	- Actions shaped by conceptions
		- Effective because it's "invisible" (in our subconscious)
		- Recognizing this conceptual shaping gives us some control over it.
			- Must understand the history of these concepts/scripts. (All of them agree that we must understand history to understand the concept of Race)

### Differences

**Appiah:** Focuses on the concept of Race in peoples' minds. 
- Knowing the history of the concept of Race is necessary because it entered language as a technical term from natural history. Like all technical terms gave it *semantic difference*.
	- Thus, study intellectuals… Since they know much about these terms.
	- Knowing the history is *necessary*.
- Believes that the idea of Race can be oppressive because it can hinder your authenticity due to being put in a group, giving you a "script".
- Focus on what we think about when we think about Race and correct false thinking.

**Haslanger/Mills:** Focused on bias/hidden meaning of the concept of Race. 
- Useful to know history because it shows it's socially constructed (Remember different kinds of …), but not necessary to understand the actual meaning of Race.
	- Knowing the history is *optional*. Helpful but NOT necessary.
- The idea of Race is intentional and used to create hierarchies.
- *Manifest concept* of Race (intuition) must be distinguished from its *operative concept*. 
	- Concept was created to create social hierarchies.
	- Can only debunk/criticize concept of Race by recognizing how it *operates*→it can operate because society claims it's a natural concept.
- The force/power of gender and race are very similar as they both show the obscured social origins of their concepts.

**Mills:** 
- People in dominant positions in social hierarchies: Have no reason to learn about those who are subordinate because it's not necessary for survival.
- Additional reason for ignorance → Moral ignorance.

Things to think about:
- Explanatory power
- Suggest responses to the hierarchy
