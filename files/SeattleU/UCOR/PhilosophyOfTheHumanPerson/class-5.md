### Evolutionary Theory
- Advantageous traits are selected because individuals who posses them are more likely to survive(+reproduce)
	- Strength, immune systems, anxiety, insomnia
### Morality
Willingness to sacrifice oneself:
- for others
- Desire to cooperate + share resources
- Tendency to prefer equitable distributions

### Darwin
Morality-ought: Is a function/property of evolution 
 - Arose from: increasing intelligence of humans(memory)
 - Social instincts (because we're social primates)
 2 Kinds of desires:
 1) appetites (intense)
	 - Comes and goes fast
 2) social desires (constant, not as intense)
	- Stays there
 Associate pain when we satisfy appetites over social desires
 
 **Critique**
 1) Doesn't really explain what we think is morality
 2) Why prefer social instincts over appetites?

### Korsgaard
Morality is the capacity to control one's behavior with an idea of what is right (normative self-government)

- Yes, it's from German philosophy, but recognizes that we have deep disagreements about norms

### Human Consciousness vs. Non-human Consciousness

**Non-Human Consciousness**
Perception is teleological
- Content of perception *contains* information about how to respond to the perceived object
**Human Consciousness**
Human perceptual content
- Colored by our attitudes to the world
Reflective distance from our perceptions
- Allows us to ask: Should I act because of this perception? Do I have good reason to act?

### Korsgaard's Theory on origins of Human Consciousness
Dominance/hierarchies: Evolutionary advantage because fewer conflicts
- Normative self-government is self-domination
**Reasoning**: Why do you think what you think?

### Foundationalism
A view of knowledge dating back to $17^{th}$ century that a branches of study all have the same foundations.
Example:
Sciences (e.g. physics, geography, chemistry) have the same foundations (logic, math)

### Basic vs. Non-Basic Beliefs

**Basic Beliefs** 
- True in-and-of-themsleves, unrelated to the truths of other beliefs
Example: 1+1=2

**Non-Basic Beliefs**
self-explanatory
