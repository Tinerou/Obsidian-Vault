Delves deep into the idea of Basic and non-basic.
Blurs the line between basic and non-basic beliefs
## In class
Thesis: Contrary to secular critics of religions, it is not irrational to believe in god, *under certain conditions*.
Proves this by saying: Debate between theists and atheists has an *assumption* that can't be justified.
- This *assumption* is that only beliefs backed by evidence are rational beliefs.

"A belief is properly basic only under certain conditions, and these conditions are the grounds of its justifications, and by extension the ground of the belief itself"

**Natural Theology**: Can use "natural powers" to arrive at a theological truth

Belief $X$ is rational because I have evidence $Y$ for $X$
- Plantinga thesis - basic beliefs
	- **Basic Belief:** True belief whose truth doesn't depend on another beliefs truth
- Old way of thinking
	- Basic if: 
		1) self evident (e.g. "Howe is either dead or alive")
		2) incorrigible (can't correct it)
- Plantinga's updated version for basic belief (remember: *certain conditions*)
	- perception beliefs
		- A belief about what you are perceiving right now
		- Someone religious might say, "I feel god's love in nature"-> god exists (from their perspective). Therefore, making it a basic belief.
		- "I see a tree" -> a tree exists
		- Experience something subjectively
	- memory beliefs
	- beliefs about people's minds

What conditions must be present?
- For religion you must be a part of it

## Notes
### Obligation
Mentions 4 different ways someone may be "obligated" towards a belief.

**Teleologically**: "It is a moral obligation arising out of a connection between certain intrinsic goods and evils and the way in which our beliefs are formed and held"(pg. 43).

**Aretetically**: "There are valuable noetic or intellectual states (whether intrinsically or extrinsically valuable); There are also corresponding intellectual virtues, habits of acting so as to promote and enhance those valuable states. Among one's obligations, then is the duty to try to foster and cultivate these virtues in oneself or others." (pg.43)
- What does *aretetically* mean?: In a general sense
- I believe he is saying that there is a sort of vision one must uphold

**Deontologically**: "This obligation attaches to us just by virtue of our having the sort of noetic equipment human beings do in fact display; it does not arise out of a connection with valuable states of affairs, Such an obligation, furthermore could be a special sort of moral obligation; on the other hand, perhaps it is a **Suigeneris** non-moral obligation"
- I believe suigeneris in this context means to do on one's own accord 

###  Groundless Beliefs
basic beliefs are not inheritely groundless
