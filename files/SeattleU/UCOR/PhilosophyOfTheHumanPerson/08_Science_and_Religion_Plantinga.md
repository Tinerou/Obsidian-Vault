## Notes

Main Topic: "Why does debate continue with science and religion?
Breakdown:
1) "The association of science with secularism, the so-called 'scientific worldview'"
2) "The alleged conflict between scientific theories of evolution and essential teachings of Christianity and other religions, for example ,that humans are created in God's image."

**Secular**: "Of or relating to the worldly or the temporal as distinguished from the spiritual or 'supernatural': not sacred"
- Non religious viewpoint or activity? (maybe)

### Science and Secularism

Remember, *teleology* - is the explanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise.

Rudolf Bultmann: "Objectifying inquiry is neither a necessity nor sufficient for science"
- *Objectifying inquiry* - "getting ourselves out of the picture", as a surgeon would refuse to operate on a family member.
- "Objectivity requires that, in doing science, we see this as something 'from our side' as it were, not to be found in the things themselves".
- We naturally think teleologically, personify the world, and display animism, for the sake of science we would have to reject these
**animism**: The attribution of soul to plants, inanimate objects, and natural phenomena

note: most of this on pg.5

*ontological naturalism* - The view that only natural physical entities exist, and there is no supernatural realm.
**Methodological Naturalism (MN)** - "Science should be done, as if, in some sense, ontological naturalism were true"
- More a "condition to science and not a statement of the universe"

Science often confused with scientific secularism, Plantinga believes that this is the underlying factor that creates distrust between science and religion.

### Evolution

#### 6 theses of evolution:
1) *Ancient Earth Thesis* - The claim that the earth is billions of years old
2) Life progressed from relatively simple to relatively complex forms
3) *Descent with Modification Thesis* - The enormous diversity of the contemporary living world has come by way  of offspring differing from their parents
4) *Common Ancestry Thesis* - Life originated at only one place on earth, all the subsequent life being related by descent to those original living creatures
5) Mechanism that drives descent with modification (popularly natural selection or genetic mutations)
6) Life developed without creative activity of God, instead just by the ordinary laws of physics and chemistry: call this the *Naturalistic Origins Thesis*.

"What is not consistent with Christian belief, however, is the claim that this process of evolution is *unguided* - that neither God nor anyone else had a hand in guiding, directing, orchestrating, or shaping it".
- A universe with or without design
Plantinga argues against Dawkins argument of, evolution revealing a universe without design.

By using scientific secularism, Dennett and Dawkins actually are going against methodological naturalism, because they are showing their subjective beliefs. Therefore, making their claim *unscientific*.

"But when Dennett, Dawkins and their friends go on to add that the process is unguided by God or any other intelligent agent, then, of course, conflict and inconsistency arise. Hence if you confuse Darwinism with *unguided* Darwinism, a confusion Dennett makes and Dawkins encourages, you will see science and religion as in conflict at this point".

**Intelligent Design(ID)** - The belief that life is too complex to have evolved through natural processes alone and must be the product of an intelligent cause.

ID is compatible with Darwinism and evolution, but not compatible with *unguided* Darwinism and evolution.

"Unguided Darwinism, a consequence of naturalism, is incompatible with theism, but is not entailed by scientific theory. It is instead a metaphysical or theological add-on", (pg. 12).
