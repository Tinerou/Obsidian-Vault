3 Questions (vague, give definitions in response)
1) Are religious beliefs compatible with scientific beliefs or a scientific worldview?
- Churchland reduces religious beliefs
- Both can change over time
- Scientific belief must be supported by method
- "Religion" 
	- moral code
	- how to build community
	- parent guide (how to raise your children)
	- ceremonial
	- food/diet
	- psycho therapy
	- "wellness strategies"
	- an account of the world
	- an account of the mind/soul
	- religious belief to maintain connection with ancestors

2) Should the actions we typically describe as “moral” be considered a product of evolution? If so, in what sense should they be considered a product of evolution?

3) Can scientific methods produce a complete theory of the mind (or brain)? Or, do we have good reason to believe that some features of our mind will remain beyond the scope of science? (I think Nagel, Churchland, and Chalmers would be great here)
- Break questions into parts:
	- "Scientific methods" 
		- 2 Churchland essays:
			- Scientific Reductionism
			- Objective vs. subjective language (Nagel also)
		- Chalmers
			- Reductionist explanations only work when we are trying to explain the function
			- physics vs biology (method of researching consciousness/mind)
		- Nagel
		- Korsgaard
			- Human vs. non-human
	- "complete theory of mind"
		- complete if it can explain all things we can do
		- vs.
		- complete = an account of consciousness/subjective experience

1) Churchland, Plantinga, … (maybe korsgaard)
	- Churchland reduces religious beliefs
2) Plantinga, Korsgaard, …
	- Maybe mention De Waal here… Argues morality is a product of evolution
3) Nagel, Churchland, Chalmers
	- Nagel and Churchland have differing views on this. Chalmers understands both of them but takes a different approach whilst considering what both Nagel and Churchland argued.
### Nagel
The *mind-body problem* is intractable because of consciousness

**mind-body problem:** How to understand the relationship between psychological phenomena and the scientific study of the brain

- To have **consciousness** means there is something that it's like to be that animal.
- *Scientific method*→Requires that all descriptions of the world must use objective language(not subjective).
	- Example: 
		- "It's warm"← subjective
		- "It's $25\degree C$" ← objective
- All successful explanations eliminate all references to subjective experience (i.e, consciousness)
Note: Martian scientist, bats

### Churchland 1: 03
- **Folk-Psychology:** Systematic understanding of world developed by cultures independently of *science*
	- E.g. Relationship between facial expressions and emotions

- **Eliminative Materialism:** As our understanding of the brain evolves, 2 things are likely:
	1) Some folk psychology will be transformed
		- e.g. addiction
	2) Some folk psychology will be eliminated
		- hysteria
- Treats concept of the soul as a part of folk psychology
	- Neuroscience of consciousness will probably lead to elimination of "soul" from our folk psychology

### Churchland 2: 02
- **Reductive explanations,** point to underlying physical processes that are *identical* to the macroscopic psychological events.
	- There is always a physical explanation to something like "love".
- The brain is the mind
	- Just like water is $H_2O$
- Rejects the claim that necessary truths can constrain science
	- Historically, all claims that science couldn't understand something by necessity was eventually wrong.
	- Goes against *Nagel* here
- A priori = prior to experience

### Chalmers
Splits the difference between Churchland and Nagel
- **Easy** problems of consciousness: 
	1) Restrict the study of consciousness to a particular function of the mind (e.g. memory)
	2) Easy because we have methods for studying functions
- **Reductive explanations** in biological sciences: 
	1) Identify a behavior with a function.
	2) Locate the underlying mechanisms in body that are needed to perform the task.
	- Goes deeper into what *Churchland* says about reductive explanations
	- Explains it as reverse engineering
- **Hard** problems of consciousness: *Nagel's* concept of subjective experience
	- subjective experience is not a function, therefore we cannot use the reductive methods.
- Use physics as the model for consciousness while treating consciousness as a fundamental feature for the universe, similar to mass. 
	- Overtime we could develop laws and discover more about it, just like physics
- *Chalmers* believes that science should be trying to explain consciousness(subjective experience), but consciousness is not a function, so that's why it is so hard to understand. Also, we could learn more about it overtime. But we won't be able to give a reductive explanation about it just like concepts in physics.

### Morality and Biology
*De Waal:* Morality is a product of *evolution*
- Defines *morality* as behaviors in social animals that are geared toward cooperation and conflict resolution, because we observe similar behaviors in species that are closely related to humans.
	- For example, laws give morality because people are afraid of going to prison
### Korsgaard
Argues against *De Waal's* conception of *morality*
Defines *morality* as, the capacity to guide one's behavior with a *concept* of right/morality.
-  You control your own behavior with your concept of right/wrong
- **Autonomy/auto-nomos**: Self rule, you generate the ideas of right and wrong
	- same as **Normative self-government** 
**Autonomy**: Requires a specific type of consciousness
- A mind with reflective distance from own *motives* → Awareness of our motives gives us the capacity to ask → "is this the right *motive*?"
Current evidence of other animals' minds: No distance from their motives… driven by *affective states*.
Humans: Have reason
Argues that the concept of right/morality comes more from culture

### Plantiga
Theistic beliefs are "properly basic" and thus not irrational
vs.
Atheist view: Religion offers an account of the world that is inferior to science and thus it's irrational to believe in theism

**Natural theology**: Understanding complexity, beauty ← Shows that there must me a divine
Non-basic beliefs
Basic beliefs→truth is independent of the truth of other beliefs
Perceptual beliefs→Rational to accept given *certain conditions* 
- Feeling the presence of the divine
- *certain conditions* → defined by community
**Methodological Naturalism:** "As if" *assumption* that there are only natural laws (things that can be described objectively). 

**Philosophical Naturalism:** Only natural things exist (*belief*). Every existing thing can be explained by the laws of nature(subjective idea that things can be described objectively… circular reasoning). [[class-7#Evolutionary Theory|Evolutionary theory]] (explains well)
