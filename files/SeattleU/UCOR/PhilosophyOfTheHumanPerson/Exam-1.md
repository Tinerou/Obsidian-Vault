3 Questions (vague, give definitions in response)
1) Are religious beliefs compatible with scientific beliefs or a scientific worldview?
- Churchland reduces religious beliefs
- Both can change over time
- Scientific belief must be supported by method
- "Religion" 
	- moral code
	- how to build community
	- parent guide (how to raise your children)
	- ceremonial
	- food/diet
	- psycho therapy
	- "wellness strategies"
	- an account of the world
	- an account of the mind/soul
	- religious belief to maintain connection with ancestors

2) Should the actions we typically describe as “moral” be considered a product of evolution? If so, in what sense should they be considered a product of evolution?

3) Can scientific methods produce a complete theory of the mind (or brain)? Or, do we have good reason to believe that some features of our mind will remain beyond the scope of science?
- Break questions into parts:
	- "Scientific methods" 
		- 2 Churchland essays:
			- Scientific Reductionism
			- Objective vs. subjective language (Nagel also)
		- Chalmers
			- Reductionist explanations only work when we are trying to explain the function
			- physics vs biology (method of researching consciousness/mind)
		- Nagel
		- Korsgaard
			- Human vs. non-human
	- "complete theory of mind"
		- complete if it can explain all things we can do
		- vs.
		- complete = an account of consciousness/subjective experience
