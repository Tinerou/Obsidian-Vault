*"Race" enters English language from academic discourse (Natural History)*
### 4-Part Thesis
1) There are no races in USA - Human race is the only race
2) Can't replace Race with culture
3) "For analytical purposes," drop the concept of race in favor of racial identity
4) "Ethical" consideration, a danger in placing too much emphasis on Racial identity to understanding ourselves and others
#### What is the meaning of "race"?
*Ideational Theory of Meaning:* Meaning of a word is the idea or set of ideas associated with the word → The rules or criteria for using the word → To know a word is to know when you can use it.
- Different ideas of race
- Racial essences (personality traits, artistic…)
*Vague criterial theory of meaning:* Must have a core set of ideas shared by all language-users … but possibility of disagreement in borderline cases.
*Referential Theory of Meaning:* Meaning of the word is the thing it points to (referent)
- "Acid" - Was used before we knew what proton donors were
- "Genes" - Before we knew DNA
- Since there is no object to represent race we use things like skin color, hair, etc. (not very informative). 
	- Because there is no such thing as race, replace concept with racial identity → [[#Why no Race?]]

**Semantic Deference**: In our society, there is a linguistic division of labor.

Appiah's Method: Explore famous intellectuals' use of "Race" to determine its meaning.
- Pre-natural history understanding of what we call race:
	- Shakespeare: No race, the religion you have separates people
	- Jefferson: Racial Essence → Blends culture and biology, no distinction between social and natural.
	- Matthew Arnold: Racial essences determine all characteristics of humans, from humor to personality types… 
	- Herder: Sprachgeist - Languages contain the collective beliefs, personalities, etc. of a people it is their nature.
		- State vs. nations: A nation has the same biology

#### Why no Race?
"Race" entered the English vocabulary through *semantic deference*.
- **semantic deference:** A concept that's *technical* enters everyday language… Experts have authority over its meaning.
	- Technical because it is like Natural History, where there is no distinction between biology and culture. (Explained cultural artifacts in terms of biology).
**Dynamic Nominalism:** Many actions are conceptually shaped because actions are *intentional*.
- Things like Race and gender are associated with their own behavioral expectations.
	- Example: As a waiter you have to know its behavioral expectations. (Takes awareness)
**Authenticity** 
Being true to yourself (similar to autonomy).
- *Social Identity* given by race can shape your *personal identity*. Most likely will make you think about your social identity more, and can cause you to conform to these social identities. (Of course not just with race).
