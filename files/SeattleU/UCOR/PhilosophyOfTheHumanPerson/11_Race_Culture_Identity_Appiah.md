### 4-Part Thesis
1) There are no races in USA - Human race is the only race
2) Can't replace Race with culture

#### What is the meaning of "race"?
*Ideational Theory of Meaning:* Meaning of a word is the idea or set of ideas associated with the word → The rules or criteria for using the word → To know a word is to know when you can use it.
*Vague criterial theory of meaning:* Must have a core set of ideas shared by all language-users … but possibility of disagreement in borderline cases.
*Referential Theory of Meaning:* Meaning of the word is the thing it points to (referent)
- "Acid" - Was used before we knew what proton donors were
- "Genes" - Before we knew DNA

**Semantic Deference**: In our society, there is a linguistic division of labor.

Appiah's Method: Explore famous intellectuals' use of "Race" to determine its meaning.
- Pre-natural history understanding of what we call race:
	- Shakespear: No race, the religion you have separates people
	- Jefferson: Racial Essence → Blends culture and biology, no distinction between social and natural.
	- Matthew Arnold: Racial essences determine all characteristics of humans, from humor to personality types… 
	- Herder: Sprachgeist - Languages contain the collective beliefs, personalities, etc. of a people it is their nature.
		- State vs. nations: A nation has the same biology
