## Reading Notes
### Use Reductionism as a Research Strategy

"I am convinced that the right strategy for understanding psychological capacities is essentially reductionist, by which I mean, broadly, that understanding the neurobiological mechanisms is not a frill but a necessity"(pg.23 or pdf_2).
- Interesting how Churchland is promoting reductionism. Very different from what Nagel's views.
- Her reasoning for the use of reductionism is that it helps understand the minds "basic components and how they are organized to constitute a system"(pg. 25 or pdf_4).

Reductionism gives directive. Example on pg. 25 pdf_4 at end of paragraph 2.

Criticizes the use of statements such as "A variation of the 'cannot imaging' proposal is expressed as 'we can never, never know . . .,' or 'is it impossible to ever understand. . .' or ' it is forever beyond science to show that'" (pg.27 or pdf_6).

A lot of talk about how the brain works, and also how much we don't know about how it works. (Honestly, most of the essay was about this and different theories people have.)
Also, a lot of arguments against people.
