What is *meaning*?
- Externalist: The meaning of a word is the thing $x$ the word refers to.
	- Referant or indexical
	- e.g. To understand the word "line" we would say to look at → ---

- Internalist/Conceptual: Meaning of a word is the idea(s) speakers have when the word is used.
	- As if you need to interview someone on what they mean by the word.
	- This is why we have to define words we use in philosophical papers

"gender" and "race"
- Up until recently, people thought both referred to natural properties

#### Error Theory
- Appiah: "Race" means Racial essence.
	- Racial essence: Set of biological qualities (personality types, skills, intelligence, moral character, artistic ability).
	- Idea to drop the word "race" and replace it with "racial identity".

#### Social Constructivist
- Race $\neq$ Racial Essence
- Race is a socially constructed concept for pragmatic reasons, viz. to organize human beings according to hierarchies.
- biological appearance do not change biological qualities.









## Notes
### Social Construction vs. Socially founded:
**Social Construction:** Socially created
**Socially Founded:** Naturally created (though social aspects may still be a factor).


**Social Contructionists:**

**Error Theorists/Elimitativists:** In agreement with social constructionists where such "socially created" things are not real, and that such things are "illusory", "false or misguided".

**Naturalists:** "*Present-day* race naturalists agree with the eliminativists and constructivists that races are not what they were once thought to be—they are not, e.g., groups with a common racial essence that explains a broad range of psychological and moral features of the group’s
members"(pg. 2). But disagree with the idea of racial "grouping" (natural features into a small set of groups that correspond roughly to the ordinary racial devisions).
- "*Full-blooded race naturalists*, believe the biology significant classification captures our current racial divisions.

### Constructionists vs. Error Theorists (Main topic)

*Constructionist on race*: "Races are social categories, i.e., that race is socially founded, enven though it is commonly assumed that races are natural categories."

*Error theorist on race* (Anthony Appiah): ...there are heritable characteristics, possessed by members of our species, that allow us to divide them into a small set of races, in such a way that all the members of these races share certain traits and tendencies with each other that they do not share with members of any other race. These traits and tendencies characteristic of a race constitute, on the racialist view, a sort of racial essence; and it is part of the content of racialism that the essential heritable characteristics...account for more than the visible morphological
characteristics—skin color, hair type, facial features—on the basis of which we make our
informal classifications", (Appiah 1993, 5). 
- Note: To me it sounds like he confuses culture with race here.
