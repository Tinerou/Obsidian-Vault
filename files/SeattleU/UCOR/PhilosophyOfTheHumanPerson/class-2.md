### Review
Reductionism in science: Reductive explanations are only objective if they eliminate subjective terms.

macro phenomenon-> micro properties
example: 
- Depression reduced down to serotonin
- Consciousness/Subjective Experience reduced to physical account
	- Harder to reduce "accurately"

Churchland kind of made an argument toward reductionism itself becoming less prominent the more we understand about the topic.

**Folk Science**: Interrelated concepts on explanatory frameworks developed by cultures:
1) Make predictions
2) Infer underlying reasons for observed x's
**Folk psychology:** 

**Eliminative Materialism:** Empirical hypothesis that as neuroscience advances, many concepts in folk psychology will be eliminated or transformed

Transformed:
- "Memory"
	- Declarative memory: Kind of like information recall
	- skill memory: Muscle memory
Self-control:
- Delay gratification: Doing something even though you know it's bad
- Cancel an action: Can't stop yourself from doing something
Patricia Churchland spoke about soul not being the same as mind (non-physical "inner life")
- Advances in science point to redundancies in our language

"Brain causes consciousness"
Good science -> Simplicity is a hallmark of good theory
The brain is the mind
- For brain to cause mind (2 things needs to exist)
- For brain to be mind
