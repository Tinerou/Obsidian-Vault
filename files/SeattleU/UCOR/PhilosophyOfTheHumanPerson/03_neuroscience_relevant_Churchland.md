### Definitions:

**Folk psychology:** "The study of the mid and behavior of different peoples through the analysis of the human factors involved in their cultural and technological development."
(Source: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/folk%20psychology)

**Eliminative Materialism:** "The *radical* claim that our ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common-sense do not actually exist and have no role to play in a mature science of the mind."
(Source: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/materialism-eliminative/)

### Defending Eliminative Materialism

"Representation should not be tied to language because, for example, rats have splendid amount of spatial knowledge, but they can't talk they're rats! ... It's knowledge cannot be characterized as a relation between its brain and a bit of its language.

Language changes with scientific discoveries:
Words like "nervous breakdown", "addiction", and "hysteria" are thought of way differently now than they were say, 20 years ago.
- Great examples at the top of pg. 178 or pdf_3

Churchland never uses the word *eliminative materialism* because "everybody misunderstands it".
