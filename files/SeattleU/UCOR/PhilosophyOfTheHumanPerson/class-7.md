### Methodological Naturalism (secularism w/ respect to science)

#### A method

Objectifying inquiry
(Nagel: Evidence in science always communicated with language that avoids subjective experience)
Personification is natural but by condition should not be used in science : [[08_Science_and_Religion_Plantinga#Science and Secularism|paragraph 2]]
- teleological
- Many humans have experiences of the divine (subjective experience→so not valid for science)

Proper method of science: Describe the world as if only natural forces exist.

*Naturalism*: Laws of nature
*Supernatural*: Outside the laws of nature
- Divine being
- Miracles

Note: Confusion between methodological naturalism and scientific secularism is what causes debate between science in religion.
### Scientific Secularism (philosophical naturalism/ontological naturalism)

#### A belief

The claim that humans only need the objectifying inquiry in science, because only natural phenomena exists
- Belief that only natural phenomena exists, due to the success of methodological naturalism in science
*Ontological*: Theory of being/ what exists

### Evolutionary Theory

- Ancient Earth Thesis
- Life progresses from simpler life to the more complex
- Descent with modification
- common ancestors thesis
- Natural selection (→ goes into descent w/ modification)
- Life created without supernatural origin

Plantinga Thesis: It is unscientific (contrary to the method of science) to claim that evolutionary theory proves there is no God(s).

Plantiga argues that Dennett and Dawkins have an argument that says: It is possible that $X$ therefore it is $X$. 
Evolutionary theory gives an account of how nature came to be through laws of nature.
- Possible that this could have happened without a divine intervention
- therefore no divine($X$) (Dennett and Dawkins view)
- This subjective idea both Dennett and Dawkins speak on is therefore *unscientific*.
- Ethics issue when subjective experience is involved in science

Occam's Razor: Simpler explanations are often better
