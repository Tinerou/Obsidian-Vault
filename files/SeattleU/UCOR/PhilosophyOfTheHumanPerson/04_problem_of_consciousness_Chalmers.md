## What we talk about 

- Distinguishing between "easy" and "hard" problems in neuroscience
- Functional explantations in biology and neuroscience
- Chalmers' suggestions for a science of consciousness
- Can science recognize phenomena that are not just physical?

**Theme:** Why is consciousness so hard to explain scientifically?

## In class

### Consciousness: Ambiguous terms
#### Easy
- Awake vs. asleep
- Aware of internal states
- Recall information
- Ability to categorize things and discriminate

Easy because we can describe them in terms of function. Which then lends them have reductive explanations.

Reductive Methods in biology:
1) We identify a macroscopic, observable phenomenon that performs a task
2) We locate the physical mechanism that makes it possible
#### Hard
Subjective experience: What it's like to be you
- Hard problem because it can't be defined functionally, which implies no reductive analysis is possible
- Thus, no physical account of consciousness is possible; No reductive explanation
## Notes

"Consciousness is an ambiguous term, referring to many different phenomena" (pg. 1).
### "Easy" problems

- The ability to discriminate, categorize, and react to environmental stimuli
- The integration of information by a cognitive system
- The reportability of mental states
- The ability of a system to access its own internal states
- The focus of attention
- The deliberate control of behavior
- The difference between wakefulness and sleep

### "Hard" problems

"The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of *experience*" (pg. 2).
- The subjective aspect

### Claim of awareness vs. consciousness
More of a proposal to normalize the separation of awareness and consciousness to separate issues into different sections.

"Reserve the term '*consciousness*' for the phenomena of experience, using the less loaded term '*awareness*' for the more straightforward phenomena described earlier". (pg. 3, paragraph 1) 
- References Newell 1990, and Chalmers 1996


"The second choice is to take a harder line and deny the phenomenon. (Variations on this approach are taken by Allport 1988, Dennett 1991, and Wilkes 1988.) According to this line, once we have explained the functions such as accessibility, reportability, and the like, there is no further phenomenon called "experience" to explain. Some explicitly deny the phenomenon, holding for example that what is not externally verifiable cannot be real. Others achieve the same effect by allowing that experience exists, but only if we equate "experience" with something like the capacity to discriminate and report. These approaches lead to a simpler theory, but are ultimately unsatisfactory. Experience is the most central and manifest aspect of our mental lives, and indeed is perhaps the key explanandum in the science of the mind. Because of this status as an explanandum, experience cannot be discarded like the vital spirit when a new theory comes along. Rather, it is the central fact that any theory of consciousness must explain. A theory that denies the phenomenon "solves" the problem by ducking the question" (pg. 7, paragraph 3).

## Terminology

**teleology**: The use of design or purpose as an explanation of natural phenomena
**physicalism**: The only things that exist are physical.
- When thinking about minds physicalism implies that, all mental events are identical physical events in the brain
**Dualism**: Minds vs. bodies
- Plato suggested the physical and non-physical realm:
	(Believed that mind exists after death, dualism itself kind of requires religion)
	- Non-physical realm: 
		- minds, math, ideals
		- Mind controls the body
