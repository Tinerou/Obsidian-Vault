### Implementing Complex Data Structures

#### Multidimensional Arrays
Consider a two dimensional array: `int a[3][4]`
Number of rows: 3
Number of columns: 4

Since memory is modeled using a one-dimensional array, the 2D array gets flattened.
*row-major order:* rows are stored sequentially (used by C++)

*column-major order:* columns are stored sequentially
