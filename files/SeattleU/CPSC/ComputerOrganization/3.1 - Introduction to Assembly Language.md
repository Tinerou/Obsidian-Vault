### Intro

- **Assembly** language is a low level programming language that provides direct access to registers and memory
- Assembly language is dependent on the microprocessor family
- An assembly language program consists of a sequence of instructions
- There is a direct correspondence between an assembly language instruction and a machine language instruction (raw 1s and 0s)
- Fixed size

#### Assembly Language Programming Process

Assembly language programming process (in ANNA):
1) Write the program in assembly language(save to a `.ac` file)
2) Assemble the program using an assembler (No news is good news)
3) Execute the machine code file in a simulator

#### Registers and Variables
Registers are memory locations inside the CPU
- Registers can be: `r0 r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7`
- Remember that `r0` is always 0, even if you try to write to it.
- ...

#### Program Counter
The **program counter(PC)** is a special register that keeps track of the address of which instruction is currently executing
- The machine program is stored in memory starting at address 0.
- The PC cannot be directly accessed by assembly instructions
- ...

#### ANNA Simulator

The simulator performs these steps upon startup
1) Each location in memory  is filled with 0.
2) All registers are set to 0
3) The program counter(PC) is set to 0
4) ...

After startup, the simulator is then controlled by the user. The simplest command is to run the program when running, the simulator

1) ...

### Arithmetic and ...

`add` has the following format:
`add` $R_DR_AR_B$ 

Example:
`add r3 r2 r7`         R(`r3`) = R(`r2`)+R(`r7`)


`in`


...
**add.ac**
```Assembly
in r1
in r2
in r3
add r4 r1 r2
add r4 r4 r3
out r4
.halt
```
