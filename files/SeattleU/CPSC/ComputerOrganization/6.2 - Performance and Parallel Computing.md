#### Amdahl's Law
**Amdahl's Law:** Assume an optimization inmproves a portion (fraction) $p$ of the computation that took time $T_{orig}$ by a factor of $s$. The time to take to run the new program is:
$$\begin{align}
T_{new} = p(\frac{T_{orig}}{s}) + (1-p)T_{orig} \\
\text{The speedup is:} \\
\text{Speedup } = \frac{T_{orig}}{T_{new}} = \frac{T_{orig}}{p(\frac{}{})}
\end{align}$$
