- Functions calls are the most difficult concept to model in assembly language
- Terminology
- *caller*
- *callee*

#### Caller Function

Upon a function call, the *caller* function needs to:
1) Pass parameters
2) See the point in code to return to (*return address*)
3) Jump to the beginning of the callee function

After the function call, the *caller* function needs to:
1) Get the return value

#### Callee Function
At the start of the function, the *callee* function needs to:
1) Extract parameters
2) Allocate space for local variables

### Function Calls in ANNA

The final ANNA assembly instruction `jalr` ("Jump And Link Register"):
`jalr`$R_DR_A$
- jumps to an address stored in register and saves PC + 1 in a different register
- $R_D$ contains the address of the function to jump to 
- $R_A$ will contain the return address (PC+1)
Operation summary for `jalr`:
