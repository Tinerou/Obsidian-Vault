### Boolean Algebra

#### What is Boolean Algebra?

**Boolean Algebra** is a mathematical system for the manipulation of variables that can have one of two values
- In formal logic, these values are "true" and "false"
- In digital systems, these values are "on" and "off", `1` and `0`, or "high" and "low"
A **Boolean Operator** performs an operation on Boolean variables.
- Common Boolean operators include *AND*, *OR*, and *NOT*
- A Boolean operator can be completely described using a truth table. 
A **Truth Table** list the output for all possible input combinations

#### Boolean Operators

The 3 basic Boolean operators are as follows:

| **NOT** operator           | **OR** operator            | **AND** operator           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Equivalent to `!` in C++   | Equivalent to \| \| in C++ | Equivalent to  `&&` in C++ |
| Called the complement      | Called the Boolean Sum     | Called the Boolean product |
| Denoted as A' (complement) | denoted A + B              | Denoted AB                 |

#### Boolean Functions

A **Boolean function** is a function of one or more Boolean variables
- Produces an output of one or more variables
Boolean operations have rules of *precedence*:
- NOT(highest priority), AND, OR respectively
Boolean functions can be *represented*
- Algebraic expression such as F(x, y, z) = xz' + y
- Truth table: Explicitly list the output for each input combination

### Logic Gates

#### What are logic Gates?

Basic Boolean functions are implemented in digital computer circuits called *gates*.

A **gate** is an electronic device that produces a result based on one or more input values.
- In reality, gates consist of 1-6 or more transistors
- Digital designers think of them as a single unit (abstraction).

**These gates directly correspond to their respective boolean operations:**

**Gates (except NOT) can have more than 2 inputs:**

**Sometimes the complement is expressed directly as input (without a NOT gate):

#### Boolean Algebra Properties

Since there are so many different circuits that can be used to implement the same Boolean function. Which is the best to use?

One way of simplifying a complex boolean function is to use Boolean algebra

### Sum-of-Products Form

#### Minterms and Terms

A **minterm** is a product(AND) involving all inputs to the functions
- For example, F(A, B, C) is a 3 input function
	- The following are minterms: ABC, AB'C, A'B'C
	- The following are *not* minterms:
		- AC - Does not involve B
		- A'B'C' - this is NAND, not AND
		- (A+B)C - OR operator not permitted
A **term** is identical to a minterm except that it does not require all inputs
- For instance, AB' and A are considered terms but not minterms

#### What is sum-of-products Form?

The **sum-of-products** form is a Boolean sum of terms.
- Example: F(A, B, C) = AB'C + BC + A'

Any Boolean function can be written in sum-of-products form
- Each row in the truth table refers to a different minterm
-  Simply create a Boolean sum of the minterms that correspond to each row that has an output of

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages from circuit perspective:**
- Fast (max gate propagation delay is 2)
- All gates can be replaced with NAND gates directly

| **1** | **0** |
| ----- | ----- |
| AND   | NOT   |
| OR    |       |
| NAND  |       |
| NOR   |       |
**Disadvantages from circuit perspective:**
- Might not be optimal in terms of number of gates
- Number of input son OR gate can be large for functions with several terms

### Designing Logical Circuits

#### Design

1) Typically use only NAND gates
	- It is a universal gate: you can implement any Boolean function with just NAND gates
	- NAND gates require fewer transistors than AND or OR gates
2) The number of inputs on a gate is capped
	- Gates with large number of inputs consume too much power and take. up too much space.
3) Designers use additional algorithms and tools to further minimize Boolean functions
	- Karnaugh maps and tabulation method

#### Multiple Bit Wires

- So far all the components dealt with a small number of bits
- Circuit diagrams would get large and cluttered if we had to specify each bit independently
- A single wire in the circuit diagram can represent multiple bits
	- Number indicates the number of bits
	- Can also label the wire to give the label meaning. The label can be used to convey the number of bits
	- Bits are numbered from n-1 to 0.

#### Multiple Bit Components

Components are also modeled with multiple bit and input and outputs:
![[Pasted image 20251008133642.png]]

#### Combinational and Sequential Logic

There are 2 types of digital circuits:
- **Combinational Circuits** - The output is exclusively based on the input. There is no memory of prior values
- **Sequential Circuits** - Incorporate a notion of time and memory. The output depends no only on the input but the prior output


### Multiplexers and Decoders

#### Multiplexers (MUX)

A **multiplexer (MUX)** selects a single output from several inputs

- The input chosen for output is determined by the value of the multiplexer's control lines
- To be able to select among *n* inputs, log_(2)*n* control lines are needed
- The term **n-to-1 mux** is used to indicate there are *n* data input lines
![[Pasted image 20251008134250.png]]

The control inputs are treated as an unsigned binary number and corresponds to which data line to select.

#### Decoders
A **decoder** is used to select a line based on a binary number (address)
	- Has *n* inputs, 2^*n* outputs
	- Exactly one output line is on(1), the rest are off(0)
Think of the input as *n* bit binary number. The line corresponding to the number is 1.
