### Introduction to Microarchitecture

#### Processor as a Finite State Machine (FSM)

#### Datapath and Control
It is common to decompose the system in two parts:
1) **Datapath:** A collection of interconnected modules that perform all the relevant computation on the data.
	- For a CPU: Set of components that perform arithmetic operations and hold data.
2) **Control Unit:** Coordinates the behavior of the datapath by issuing appropriate control signals.
	- For a CPU: Command the datapath, memory, I/O devices, according to the current instruction.

### ANNA Datapath

#### Assumptions
Datapath will omit these instructions:
- `jalr`: left as an exercise
- `in`, `out`: requires special I/O hardware
Ignore startup: Assume registers, memory, and PC have proper initial state.
Initial datapath will be single cycle. Each instruction takes one cycle to execute.
